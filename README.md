# Credit Card Fraud Detection  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project provides an **end-to-end Credit Card Fraud Detection system** using advanced machine learning and ensemble techniques. It covers **data preprocessing, class balancing, hyperparameter tuning, model training, evaluation, and comparison** to handle the challenges of highly imbalanced fraud datasets.

## 🔹 Key Highlights  

### 🔧 Data Handling & Preprocessing  
- Scaling with different techniques (e.g., **RobustScaler**).  
- Balancing imbalanced datasets with **oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE**, and more.  

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models  
- **Random Forest** (RandomizedSearch hyperparameter tuning).  
- **Logistic Regression** (GridSearch optimization).  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (randomized parameter search).  
- **Neural Network (MLPClassifier)** with configurable layers, activations, and solvers.  
- **Voting Classifier** (ensemble of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network).  

### 📊 Model Evaluation  
- Metrics: **Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**, and threshold tuning.  
- Automated **comparison tables** and **visualization plots** for model benchmarking.  

### ⚙️ Configurable Workflow  
- Controlled via **YAML config files** (`config.yml`, `trainer_config.yml`).  
- Enable/disable models, adjust balancing strategies, and fine-tune hyperparameters.

## 📤 Outputs  
- Trained models saved with **timestamps** in `models/`.  
- Evaluation plots for **performance analysis**.  
- Markdown-formatted **model comparison reports**.
